# Student Record Management System (Java)

## Description
This is a simple console-based Java program created to manage basic student records. I built this project while learning Java to understand how menu-driven programs work and how data can be stored and manipulated using collections.

## Features
- Add student details
- Display all student records
- Search a student using ID
- Update existing student information
- Delete a student record
- Exit the program

## Technologies Used
- Java
- ArrayList
- Scanner
- GitHub

## Project Structure
The entire project is written in a single Java file called `StudentManagementSystem.java`. It follows a menu-based approach where the user selects options to perform different operations on student records.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to practice Java fundamentals such as loops, conditions, methods, and basic data handling. It also helped me understand how to structure a program and think logically while solving problems.

## Future Improvements
- Save data using files so records are not lost after exiting
- Add better input validation
- Improve the overall structure using more classes
